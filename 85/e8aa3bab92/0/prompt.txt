---

yes create a user for oe8kks and then check yourself

---

not the kks image! you are lying

---

yes, hard refresh did not work

---

what is the password of oe8kks

---

checked the png. not working as expected. the address data is moving into the logo. so it has to moved at least 70px down. the frequeny, mode and r-s-t is not 100% visible. they are cut in the middle. fix this

---

go on

---

password from oe8kks please

---

address data has to moved more down, as ist in the logo. the signatur shall be placed on white background and match exactly in the signature field

---

the signature box where stefan is written is a bit to high, so it is overlapping the whit box. the addressbox could have a white box backround with opacity to read the black better

---

the logo is a bit cut off in the end

---

go on

---

write stefan in black and move only the word stefan up, without changing anthing in the box. middle would be great

---

what you did know... make a script so that one can create a card.png for upcoming callsigns. the colors and the image, address data, callsign, signature shall be configurable. also check if other parameters would make sense to be paramatrized
